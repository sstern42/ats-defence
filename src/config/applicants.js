/**
 * Applicant stats. Plain data, no logic, so balance can be tuned without
 * going anywhere near the game loop.
 *
 * `bounty` is what rejecting one pays back into the screening budget.
 *
 * How often an applicant turns up is a property of the wave, not of the type,
 * so it lives in waves.js.
 *
 * The optional fields are what makes a type awkward, and each one is read in
 * exactly one place:
 *
 * - `immuneTo` lists tower types that cannot touch it. Those towers do not
 *   even take aim, so nobody wastes a shot on it.
 * - `priorityFor` names a tower type that goes for it ahead of whoever is
 *   closest to the vacancy.
 * - `spawnProgress` starts it partway along the path, from 0 to 1.
 * - `returns` means it comes back once at the end of the wave, whether it was
 *   rejected or reached the vacancy.
 * - `pressure` is how hard it leans on a screening mechanism it walks past, in
 *   integrity per second. Only the open advert mode reads it, since that is the
 *   only mode where applicants push back at all, and how far they can reach is
 *   a property of that mode rather than of the type. A Referral does the most
 *   damage by a distance, which is the joke: it knows somebody.
 *
 * Every type has a `pressure` even where it is small, because a Graduate on its
 * own is not a problem and forty of them standing round one desk is.
 *
 * Two fields are presentation, and they are here because the numbers next to
 * them already decide how the thing looks. `sprite` names the art, from the
 * manifest in art.js, and `colour` tints it and draws the health bar. The art
 * is greyscale so one sprite can serve more than one type. `radius` is what the
 * sprite is scaled to, as well as being where the health bar sits.
